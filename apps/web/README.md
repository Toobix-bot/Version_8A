# ECHO Playground — Web (placeholder)

This directory will host a Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui frontend. For now it's a placeholder with instructions to scaffold the app later.

Scaffold locally when ready:

```powershell
npx create-next-app@latest apps/web
# then install tailwindcss, shadcn/ui, and other dependencies per project needs
```
