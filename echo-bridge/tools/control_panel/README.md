# Control Panel (Placeholder)

This directory was referenced but did not exist. Created as a placeholder.

Planned contents:
- Unified PowerShell panel to:
  - Start / stop MCP backend
  - Start / stop bridge
  - Start / stop tunnel (quick or named)
  - Auto-patch manifest/openapi
  - Display /action_ready status loop
  - Show metrics (/metrics)

Next steps: add `control_panel.ps1` with interactive menu.
